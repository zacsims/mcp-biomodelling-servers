# PhysiCell MCP Server

A PhysiCell MCP server is connected. Call its tools via the MCP tool calling mechanism (like Read, Write, Bash). Tools have prefix `mcp__PhysiCell__`. Do NOT run them via Bash or subprocess. Do NOT write PhysiCell XML or C++ manually.

For detailed guidance on simulation setup, Hill function rules, common mistakes, and workflows, use the `physicell-simulation` skill.
